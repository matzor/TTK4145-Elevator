# TTK4147 - Real Time Programming Elevator project

Project for Real Time Programming course at NTNU.

elevio.d is written by Klasbo. 
network_peers.d is heavily inspired by Klasbo from the network excersise, but was customized to fit our use.
To run the elevator, do "./main" or if your comuter got rdmd installed: "rdmd main.d"
You can configure the elevator parameters by editing the config files elev.conf and net.conf.
